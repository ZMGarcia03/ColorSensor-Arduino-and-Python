# ColorSensor-Arduino-and-Python
Creating a code for an Arduino color sensor that generates a hex code for the detected color requires both Arduino and Python programming. The Arduino code will read the color data from the color sensor and send it to the computer through the serial port. Python code will receive the data from the Arduino and convert the RGB values to a hex code.
